# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-cpp
Simple data structure and algorithms using c++

BinarySearchTree:
This cpp file contains code to read take csv parser output and create a BST using structs.
It contains the methods necessary to add and remove nodes, perform an inorder traversal, and search for a node.

TrieOperations:
This is a very simple overview of working with trie data structures, showing how to create a trie, add strings, and perform a search.
